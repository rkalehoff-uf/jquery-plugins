                <p>I can't do that as Bruce Wayne... as a man. I'm flesh and blood. I can be ignored, destroyed. But as a symbol, I can be incorruptible, I can be everlasting.</p>

                <p>The first time I stole so that I wouldn't starve, yes. I lost many assumptions about the simple nature of right and wrong. And when I traveled I learned the fear before a crime and the thrill of success. But I never became one of them.</p>

                <p>Theatricality and deception, powerful agents to the uninitiated. But we are initiated aren't we, Bruce? Members of the League of Shadows. And you betrayed us.</p>

                <p>You know what you said about the structures becoming shackles. You were right and I can't take it, the injustice. I mean, no one ever's gonna know who saved the entire city.</p>

                <p>Tomorrow, you will be released. If you are bored of brawling with thieves and want to achieve something there is a rare blue flower that grows on the eastern slopes. Pick one of these flowers. If you can carry it to the top of the mountain, you may find what you were looking for in the first place.</p>

                <p>You want order in Gotham. Batman must take off his mask and turn himself in. Oh, and every day he doesn't, people will die. Starting tonight. I'm a man of my word.</p>

                <p>I climbed out of the pit. I found my father and brought him back to exact terrible vengeance. But by that time, the prisoners and the doctor had their work to my friend, my protector. The League took us in and trained us but my father could not accept Bane. He saw only a monster, whose very existence was the reminder of the hell he'd left his wife to die in. He excommunicated Bane from the League of Shadows. His only crime was that he loved me. I could not forgive my father, until you murdered him.</p>

                <p>It means you're hatred, and it also means losing someone, who I've cared for since I first heard his cries echoing through this house. But it might also mean saving your life. And that is more important.</p>
